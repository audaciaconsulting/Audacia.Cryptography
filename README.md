# Overview

The `Audacia.Cryptography` repository contains Cryptographic utilities for Audacia projects. Asymmetrical encryption used for encrypting strings. The strings are encrypted using a public key (belonging to the client) and decrypted using a private key (in the server). Whilst it is capable of dealing with larger strings, please exercise caution with any excessively large payloads as it can cause an out of memory exception.
